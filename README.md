# dotfiles

_These are just my dotfiles. I used GNU Stow to keep them in one place._

## THE CONFIGs:
- .wezterm.lua (for WezTerminal)
- .config/nvim (for NEOVIM)
- .zshrc (for ZSHELL)

## OTHER STUFF:
- .spotify.sh (sometimes Spotify doesn't open up... so this clears the cache... flatpak nightmare)
